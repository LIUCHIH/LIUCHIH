<h1>Creative Computing</h1>
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Helena Liu. It is my first time learning about this growing field, and I will use this READ.ME file platform to document my journey. I hope this can also help those who are first-time learners of creative computing, who are also trying to figure out their way around. 

## Introduction: Definitions
#### <p> Creative computing: <br> 
<p> Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines. People use computers as aids to creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. This involves coding, building apps, craft digital experiences, explore machine intelligence and more which are valued by today's businesses with <strong> higher demand!</strong> 
#### <p> Physical computing:<br> 
<p> Physical computing means interacting with real-world objects by programming them from a computer. Examples includes automatic doors and voice recognition. For this project, Arduino is the platform we use which is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
#### <p> Open source: <br> computer software that is released for use by anyone, for any purpose. 
#### <p> ReadME file: <br> The Readme file is often the first file which the users read. It is a text file that contains the information for the user about the software, project, code,
game, or it might contain instructions, help, or details about the patches or updates. 
#### <p> STEAM: <br> stands for science, technology, engineering, arts and maths - acknowledging that the arts are a huge part of the scientific industry.<br>
Platforms:
#### <p> Tinkercad is a free-of-charge, online 3D modeling program that runs in a web browser. Since it became available in 2011 it has become a popular platform for creating models for 3D printing as well as an entry-level introduction to constructive solid geometry in schools
##### <p> Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices.

#### Description: In class, I learned how to to build a circult by watching the tutorial link that was on the moodle page. <br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0KErKHxHf0&list=PLT6rF_I5kknMP26rGOy8bDwZs3wbniwU9&index=12on <br>
It was unsuccessful. Although we followed the step-to-step guide, the light only flikers once connected. We believed it was due to faulty wires/other equipment. So afterclass I decided to use my knowledge of building the circult and applying onto Arduino.

Side note first time learners trying to upload video onto Github.
How to upload images onto Github?
Send the image from your phone to your computer.
Go on the raw file on Github
Select the file image and drag it directly to the raw file on Github 
See if it works properly by pressing the preview button (next to the 'edit file' button) 
SUCCESS! 
 
How to upload videos onto Github?
For videos you need to make it a mp4 file. 
My first trial, I draged the mp4 file directly from my mac to this raw space and when I pressed preview it was like this <br>

I don't the reason behind this, but I figured it might be something to do with the file size... so, I went online and compressed the file and then dragged it onto this raw space. 
 It then work! SUCCESS!

Reflection
 I started this week being overwhelmed by the term 'creative computing.' <br> 
<strong> WHY? </strong> <br> I have yet learned anything about it so it is out of my con fort zone to touch this field, yet, I know it is a growing industry that continues to develop. <br>
