<h1>Creative Computing</h1>
Hello, Iâ€™m new to arduino and tinkercad. <strong> Perhaps you are just the same as ME! </strong> <br>
It is my first time learning about creative computing, and I will use this READ.ME file platform to document my journey. (I hope this can also help/encourage those who are first-time learners of creative computing, who are also trying to figure out their way around.) <br>
> I have a mini-guide to help first time users at the end of this presentation! :)

## Introduction: Definitions
<h5> Here are some of the definitions that are useful in starting off this project. </h5>
<p> Creative computing: <br> 
<p> Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines. People use computers as aids to creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. This involves coding, building apps, craft digital experiences, explore machine intelligence and more which are valued by today's businesses with <strong> higher demand!</strong> </h5>
<p> Physical computing:<br> 
<p> Physical computing means interacting with real-world objects by programming them from a computer. Examples includes automatic doors and voice recognition. For this project, Arduino is the platform we use which is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
<p> Open source: <br> 
 <p>Open sourse is a computer software that is released for use by anyone, for any purpose. 
<p> ReadME file: <br> <p>The Readme file is often the first file which the users read. It is a text file that contains the information for the user about the software, project, code,game, or it might contain instructions, help, or details about the patches or updates. 
<p> STEAM: <br> <p> STEAM stands for science, technology, engineering, arts and maths - acknowledging that the arts are a huge part of the scientific industry.<br>
<p> Platforms:
<p> Tinkercad is a free-of-charge, online 3D modeling program that runs in a web browser. Since it became available in 2011 it has become a popular platform for creating models for 3D printing as well as an entry-level introduction to constructive solid geometry in schools 
<p> Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices.


## ðŸŒ± Physical Computing: Practical

In class, I learned how to to build a circult by watching the tutorial link that was on the moodle page. <br>
It was unsuccessful. Although we followed the step-to-step guide, the light only flikers once connected. <br>
We believed it was due to faulty wires/other equipment. We accept that it didn't work. 
 <p> Sometimes technology fail and it is common! Don't doubt yourself! It happens sometimes!
 
## ðŸŒ± Physical Computing: Arduino
 
After the unsuccessful trial, I decided to use my knowledge of building the circult and applying onto Arduino. <br>
Out of the projects listed, I was interested in Project 3: Love-o-Meter. <br>
This is the code I made while following the Arduino step-to-step guide on the left hand side. <br>

<br>
<p> The Love-o-Meter measures your body temperature and lights up a string of LEDs to show you how "hot" you are. <br>
 I find this so cool and enjoyed myself while following the step to step guide to create this circult! <br>
 It was easy to follow so I bet you can do it too!

## ðŸŒ± Playing with Tinkercad 3d Design

<p> I decided to try out the other platform that was shown to us on moodle page, Tinkercad. I created a 3d platform to introduce myself. <br>
 The reason why I did this was because I was unfamiliar with the website but I saw there was a map function in one of the objects which I was curious to play around with.

1. Create an account (if you haven't done so)<br>
2. It should bring you to a page like this. Press the search icon. <br>

3. It then takes you to another page to search for the person/design. <br>
Type in to the search engine ' Helena Liu Introducing me' <br>

 4. The first one is my work! Click on it and press 'Tinkerthis' 

## ðŸŒ± Reflection
I initially thought this week we would be learning about coding, and was overwhelmed just by the term 'creative computing.' I didn't know exactly what we were going to do which made me anxious and excited at the same time. Anxious, because I have yet learned anything about it so it is out of my confort zone to touch this field, yet....excited, because I know it is a growing industry that continues to develop so I have always wanted to try it and learn more about it. I approached the brief with an open mind, I started by experimenting with Arduino by doing some of the task, and later on with Tinkercad. I didn't have a set objective at the start of the week, and was not too stressed to create a set outcome which made the week enjoyable while discovering more creative computing while learning and doing. It has shown me a new pathway of creating which could be used in future projects, and I would like to continue to discover and play.

> Guide for first time learners trying to upload video onto Github.

###### How to upload images onto Github?
1. Send the image from your phone to your computer.<br>
2. Go on the raw file on Github <br>
3. Select the file image and drag it directly to the raw file on Github <br>
4. See if it works properly by pressing the preview button (next to the 'edit file' button) <br>
<strong> SUCCESS! </strong>
 
###### How to upload videos onto Github?
1. For videos you need to make it a mp4 file.<br>  
2. Drag the file onto the raw file on Github <br>
3. For me, when I dragged the mp4 file directly from my mac to this raw space and when I pressed preview the video was very <strong> brIGHT </strong> <br>
4. If this is the case for you2, then compress the file and then drag onto the raw space. 
5. See if it works properly by pressing the preview button (next to the 'edit file' button) <br>
<strong> SUCCESS! </strong>
<br>
 
Thank you!
