<h1>Creative Computing</h1>
👋 Hi, I’m Helena Liu. It is my first time learning about this growing field, and I will use this READ.ME file platform to document my journey. I hope this can also help those who are first-time learners of creative computing, who are also trying to figure out their way around. 


## Introduction: Definitions
#### <p> Creative computing: <br> 
<p> Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines. People use computers as aids to creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. This involves coding, building apps, craft digital experiences, explore machine intelligence and more which are valued by today's businesses with <strong> higher demand!</strong> 
#### <p> Physical computing:<br> 
<p> Physical computing means interacting with real-world objects by programming them from a computer. Examples includes automatic doors and voice recognition. For this project, Arduino is the platform we use which is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
#### <p> Open source: <br> computer software that is released for use by anyone, for any purpose. 
#### <p> ReadME file: <br> The Readme file is often the first file which the users read. It is a text file that contains the information for the user about the software, project, code,
game, or it might contain instructions, help, or details about the patches or updates. 
#### <p> STEAM: <br> stands for science, technology, engineering, arts and maths - acknowledging that the arts are a huge part of the scientific industry.<br>

Reflection
 I started this week being overwhelmed by the term 'creative computing.' <br> 
<strong> WHY? </strong> <br> I have yet learned anything about it so it is out of my con fort zone to touch this field, yet, I know it is a growing industry that continues to develop. <br>
